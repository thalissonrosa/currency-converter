# Currency Converter

This is an app where the user can select a currency, input a value and get the converted value in several  currencies. This app was created as the coding challenge for PayPay.

## Getting Started

There was no guidelines regarding the usage of CocoaPods and third party libraries, so it was assumed that they should not be used. To run the app, just clone the repository and use the development branch.

### Improvements
To make the app better, one big change would be to add RxSwift to transition from the MVC to MVVM. Moving the business logic to ViewModel and using bindings to connect the data with the UI would be a great improvement. That would make the code cleaner, requiring less code to achieve the same result.
